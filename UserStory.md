# User Story Template

## What is a User Story?
A user story is a simple way to describe a feature from the user's perspective. It helps us understand what the user wants to achieve and why it's important to them.

## Basic Template
```
As a [type of user],
I want to [do something],
So that [I get some benefit]
```

## Example
```
As a student,
I want to save my favorite recipes,
So that I can quickly find them later
```

## How to Write a Good User Story

### 1. Identify the User
- Who will use this feature?
- What is their role? (student, teacher, customer, etc.)
- What are their needs?

### 2. Describe What They Want
- What action do they want to take?
- What feature do they need?
- Keep it simple and clear

### 3. Explain Why They Want It
- What problem does it solve?
- What benefit will they get?
- How will it make their life better?

## Example Stories

### Example 1: Simple Feature
```
As a busy parent,
I want to set up automatic bill payments,
So that I don't miss any payment deadlines
```

### Example 2: Social Feature
```
As a social media user,
I want to share photos with my friends,
So that they can see what I'm up to
```

### Example 3: Learning Feature
```
As a language learner,
I want to practice vocabulary with flashcards,
So that I can remember new words better
```

## Tips for Writing Stories
1. Keep it simple and clear
2. Focus on what the user wants to achieve
3. Use everyday language
4. Make sure the benefit is clear
5. One story = one feature

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Too technical: "As a user, I want the system to implement OAuth2"
- ✅ Better: "As a user, I want to log in with my Google account"

- ❌ Too vague: "As a user, I want to use the app"
- ✅ Better: "As a user, I want to track my daily water intake"

## Story Checklist
- [ ] Is it written from the user's perspective?
- [ ] Is the action clear and specific?
- [ ] Is the benefit clear?
- [ ] Is it simple enough to understand?
- [ ] Can it be completed in a reasonable time?

## Notes
- Don't worry about being perfect
- Start simple and improve as you learn
- Focus on what the user needs, not how to build it
- If you're not sure, ask: "What would make this better for the user?"
